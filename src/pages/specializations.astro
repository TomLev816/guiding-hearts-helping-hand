                <p>
                    Navigating the end of life—your own or that of someone you love—is among the most vulnerable experiences we encounter. Approaching the end of life, whether for oneself or a loved one, brings a unique set of emotional, spiritual, and practical considerations. We walk alongside individuals and families during this sacred time with compassion, honesty, and a steady presence.

                    Caring for someone you love is a profound act—but it can also bring deep exhaustion, guilt, overwhelm, and  emotional strain.

We provide a space where caregivers can pause, breathe, and be cared for themselves.

                <p>
                    Losing a loved one is one of life's most painful experiences. Grief is not something to "get over"—it is something to be carried, honored, and gently tended to. Whether your loss is recent or long ago, expected or sudden, we offer compassionate, non-judgmental support to help you navigate the complex emotions of grief. We are here to support you through the pain, confusion, and tenderness that can arise. Together we can find pathways towards healing and integration of loss into life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our approach is gentle and affirming, creating space for sorrow, memory, and healing—at your own pace, in your own way. Grief has no timeline.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight text-bold font-serif text-2xl italic text-center text-[#575654] my-8">
                You are not broken. You are grieving—and that deserves care.
